I am an accomplished professional in web development with 3 years of experience and a passion to create IT products and solutions which would **help people in the most humane**, **sincere** and **reliable ways** as possible. I adore working in **healthcare**, **education** and **business** fields. I’m **capable to design, implement and maintain** wide variety of systems. Strong in web development using both, **server side** and **client side** technologies. **I‘m really fascinated with how new technologies are developing and I am proud of myself being a part of it**.

I have pretty tall demands when it comes to a satisfying work environment. Not only I need to be able to express my creativity and insight, I also need to know that what I am doing has meaning, helps people, leads to personal growth and, all the while, is in line with my values, principles and beliefs.

Oftentimes the best way for me to achieve this is to not have to answer to others’ rules at all – to be my own boss, neither above nor below anyone else, just directly interacting with the people and ideas that are important to them. All that being said, I am clever and inspired, and with a few of the right conditions, most any position can be made to work.

###As subordinate

I am likely to chafe under hardline rules, formal hierarchies and routine tasks. I value diplomacy and sensitivity, and the more democratic and personal my manager’s style is, and the more I feel my independence and input are valued, the happier I’ll be. I act on my convictions, so when I do something, it’s something that has meaning to me – if those actions come under criticism, even justified complaints, but especially unwarranted ones, my morale is likely to tank spectacularly.
A manager’s values need to be naturally aligned with me for both parties to be most effective. Though usually idealistic, if I feel in conflict, I can lose touch with that sense and end up all too bitter. But if it’s a balance I can handle, with a little encouragement every now and then, I will be hardworking, trustworthy, and more than capable of handling my responsibilities and professional relationships.

###As colleague

As colleague, I am likely to become quite friendly, being seen as positive, eloquent and capable friends, identifying others’ motives and defusing conflicts and tension before anyone else even senses a disturbance. I am likely to prioritize harmony and cooperation over ruthless efficiency, encouraging a good, hardworking atmosphere and helping others when needed. While this is usually a strength, there is a risk that others will take advantage of my commitment to their responsibilities by simply shifting their burdens onto my desk.
It should also be remembered that at the end of the day, I am still an Introvert, and my engagement isn’t always welcome – I will need to step back and act the lone wolf from time to time, pursuing my own goals in my own ways. An unhealthy version of this tendency may pop up if I sense that my values are being compromised by a more ethically relaxed colleague.

###As manager

As manager, I am often reluctant in exercising their authority, preferring to see their subordinates as equals,coordinating and supervising people, leaving the technical systems and factual details to more capable hands, and working hard to inspire and motivate, not to crack the whip. That’s not to say that I have lax standards – far from it – as my sense of equality means that I expect my subordinates to be as competent, motivated and reliable as myself.

Though sensitive, understanding, principled and just, able to appreciate individual styles and to make accurate judgments about others’ motivations, if a subordinate’s actions or attitude undermines my ethics or values, I will find little comfort in these qualities. I have no tolerance for lapses in reliability or morality. But, so long as no such lapse occurs, I will work tirelessly to ensure that their subordinates feel valued and happy.
