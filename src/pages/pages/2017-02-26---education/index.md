###Parkinson's disease detection using voice signal decomposition
*Date: Mar 26, 2018*

**Journal: Biomedical Signal Processing and Control (waiting for approval)**

Accurate detection of Parkinson's disease by acoustic analysis of sustained phonation is the goal of this research. Phonation corresponds to the vowel /a/ voicing task and was recorded through two channels simultaneously, namely, acoustic cardioid (AC) and smart phone (SP) microphones. Signal decomposition into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is explored in a novel way to create an expert system for medical decision support. Decomposition approaches considered are empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and variational mode decomposition (VMD). Several frequency signatures, -- Bark frequency cepstral coefficients (BFCC), Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and perceptual linear predictive cepstral coefficients (PLPCC), -- are tested as audio descriptors to characterize each extracted IMF as well as the original signal. Random forest (RF) classifier is used both as a base-learner and as a meta-learner for the decision-level fusion. Baseline solution by summarizing cepstral coefficients from all frames of a voice recording through statistical functionals was compared to the proposed solution of using EMD and VMD of a single center frame or three evenly-spaced frames and summarizing base-learner's decisions instead. Experiments indicate that the voice signal decomposition followed by the decision-level fusion is capable to improve the detection performance and achieve the out-of-bag equal error rate of ~1% for AC and ~12% for the SP channel.

###Voice signal decomposition for Parkinson's disease detection
*Date: Jun 6, 2017*

**KTU Master's work and presentation**

Thesis „Voice signal decomposition for Parkinson‘s disease detection“ goal of this research is the robust detection of Parkinson’s disease by acoustic analysis of sustained voice recordings.Application  of  signal  decomposition  into  intrinsic  mode  functions  (IMFs)  is  investigated  as  a novel  type  of  audio  features  and  a  custom  solution  for  decision-level  fusion,  employing  statistical functionals to compress decisions from all IMFs. Similar  research  analysis  was  made.  Analysis  was  based  on  the  selected  criteria  and  it  was decided  whether  it  was  worthwhile  to  do  a  research  with  selected  methodologies. Proposed  audio features  are  perceptual  linear  predictive  cepstral  coefficients  (PLPCCs)  estimatedon  the  extracted components from one or several equally-spaced  windows of audio signal. Decompositions used are empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and variational mode decomposition (VMD). Random forest (RF) is used as a base detector as well as meta learner for decision-level fusion. Cost of log-likelihood ratio(Cllr)and equal error rate (EER) were used to measure goodness-of-detection. During  the  experiment,  1134  voice  recordings  database  was  used,  which  content  consisted  of healthy  and  sick  patients with  different  genders  and  sustainable  vowel  /a/  pronunciation. Baseline solution using PLPCCs from all frames was compared to several types of decision-level fusion (EMD, VMD, and EMD+VMD) using 1–3 windows of various sizes (10–100 ms).Decomposition-based PLPCCs and EMD+VMD fusion from three 30 ms sized windows resulted in detection performance with an average EER of 6.5% and clearly outperformed the baseline solution of decomposition-less PLPCCs, having EER of 32.9%. Variable importance from meta RF found both decompositions as useful and variance-related statistics of base RF decisions as the most important.System prototype was designed and was created to share and put to the test the research results. Prototype system was created according todescribed product definition, system limitations, functional and non-functional requirements, hierarchy chart, technical specifications, the logical architecture, the business logic, use Case diagram, the user interface and user's Manual.The conclusions describe what has been done and additional notes or note patterns.

###The provision of health care services on the internet
*Date: May 22, 2015*

**KTU Bachelor's work and presentation**

„The provision of health care services on the internet“ - is a health management information system, which according to the customer's requirements has the desired health care services (patient remote observation, visits, education) functions and is developed by UAB „Amidus“ and UAB „Blue Bridge“ corporations. The developed system modules will improve Kaunas clinics provided health care services, to create opportunities for cost savings, time and money, reduce the administrative burden and increase Kaunas clinics service availability and accessibility. The created health care services will create an added value for both patients and clinics workers.

Similar systems analysis, and technology analysis was made. Systems analysis was based on the selected criteria and it was decided whether it was worthwhile to develop such a system, as it will be superior to the existing ones. Technology analysis comprises software analysis. Software analysis, based on the selected criteria were based on different technologies of database management systems, software libraries and standards, web services, and web application technologies. When the system analysis was done, system actors was defined (patient, doctor, specialist, worker, devices administrator, education administrator, server, communicating server) and use cases drawn functional system requirements. Also non-functional system requirements were defined. When requirements were done, components diagram, sequences diagrams, database schema and the class diagrams were created. With the project implemented in a prototype system, the report provides a realistic user interface views. The realized prototype was tested using the test plan and test cases. Individual components were tested by using black box approach and the integration of components were tested by using “bottom-up” integration testing method. The conclusions describe what has been done and additional notes or note patterns.
