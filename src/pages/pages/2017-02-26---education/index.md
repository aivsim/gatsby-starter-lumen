###Exploiting voice signal decomposition in expert system for Parkinson's disease detection
*Date: Jun 6, 2017*

**KTU Master's work and presentation**

The goal of this research is the robust detection of Parkinson’s disease by acoustic analysis of sustained voice recordings. Application of signal decomposition into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is investigated as a novel type of audio features and a custom solution for decision-level fusion, employing statistical functionals to compress decisions from all IMFs. Proposed audio features are perceptual linear predictive cepstral coefficients (PLPCCs) estimated on the extracted components from one or several equally-spaced windows of audio signal. Decompositions used are empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and variational mode decomposition (VMD). Random forest (RF) is used as a base detector as well as meta learner for decision-level fusion. Cost of log-likelihood ratio and equal error rate (EER) were used to measure goodness-of-detection. Baseline solution using PLPCCs from all frames was compared to several types of decision-level fusion (EMD, VMD, and EMD+VMD) using 1–3 windows of various sizes (10–100 ms). Decomposition-based PLPCCs and EMD+VMD fusion from three 30 ms sized windows resulted in detection performance with an average EER of 6.5% and clearly outperformed the baseline solution of decomposition-less PLPCCs, having EER of 32.9%. Variable importance from meta RF found both decompositions as useful and variance-related statistics of base RF decisions as the most important.

###The provision of health care services on the internet
*Date: May 22, 2015*

**KTU Bachelor's work and presentation**

„The provision of health care services on the internet“ - is a health management information system, which according to the customer's requirements has the desired health care services (patient remote observation, visits, education) functions and is developed by UAB „Amidus“ and UAB „Blue Bridge“ corporations. The developed system modules will improve Kaunas clinics provided health care services, to create opportunities for cost savings, time and money, reduce the administrative burden and increase Kaunas clinics service availability and accessibility. The created health care services will create an added value for both patients and clinics workers.

Similar systems analysis, and technology analysis was made. Systems analysis was based on the selected criteria and it was decided whether it was worthwhile to develop such a system, as it will be superior to the existing ones. Technology analysis comprises software analysis. Software analysis, based on the selected criteria were based on different technologies of database management systems, software libraries and standards, web services, and web application technologies. When the system analysis was done, system actors was defined (patient, doctor, specialist, worker, devices administrator, education administrator, server, communicating server) and use cases drawn functional system requirements. Also non-functional system requirements were defined. When requirements were done, components diagram, sequences diagrams, database schema and the class diagrams were created. With the project implemented in a prototype system, the report provides a realistic user interface views. The realized prototype was tested using the test plan and test cases. Individual components were tested by using black box approach and the integration of components were tested by using “bottom-up” integration testing method. The conclusions describe what has been done and additional notes or note patterns.
