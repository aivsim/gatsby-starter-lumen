#### Requirements
Requirements came straight from the business owner. It all started from an existing system rewrite and in need to simplify the existing solution even more. 

We started to create new system from the already existing one, so the entity of the system was already known and was familiar. Our goals was to make system work fast and users had to have great, and most importantly **clear** user experience by using newly created system.

Modules were implemented as follows: visit module, medical forms module prescription module, templates module, popular prescriptions module, prescription and forms sign module, payment module, reports module.

At the same time we had to have both: the old and the new system. After several months the user transition was done and the older system pages were refactored and removed from our code base.
