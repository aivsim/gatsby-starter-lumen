The accounting information system is designed for General State Forest Management to help accumulate accounting, analysis, activity information for forest enterprises. It is used for keeping and managing data relating to forest restoration, use, nursery activities, wood production, trade and other data gathering.

* Almost **15 different technologically obsolete** programs were used (since 1990);
* Data were **not accumulated in a centralized manner**;
* **4 different** accounting programs;
* **42 different** databases - difficult to install updates;
* Programs were **not suited for data security**;
* **Complicated** control of forest enterprises;
* **There were no data exchange** with other institutions;
* **No processes optimization** - data are filled several times repeatedly in different programs;
* **Reports** are generated **manually** - usually excel format;
* Bir≈æai Municipality State Forest (and most other municipalities) used "FoxPro" platform, which was only supported by 2016.
