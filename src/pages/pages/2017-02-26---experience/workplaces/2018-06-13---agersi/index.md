After spectacular and greatly evaluated work in previous company, its Director offered me a job with a remote role in his parent company abroad.
Currently I am on a project working remotely with another team in Kaunas, collaborating over online meetings.
I am also managing a small group of people, pair programming with them, reviewing code, talking directly with business people, testers and other programmers.

To be continued...
