### Books
This week I started reading [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) - Read from 0 to 48 page. Completed chapters about clean code, meaningful names and functions. A small summary of these chapters:
### Programming:

One thing to take note is that getting good at a craft takes time but also we sometimes underestimate what we know and overestimate what others do. Sometimes try to teach a pure beginner about programming, it's at that point you might be able to reflect and see that you have actually acquired a lot of knowledge in your field.
Learning a new language can be daunting because we don't like that funny feeling of being a newbie, but it's alright, it's normal and actually, the experience you had with a former language goes with you when you learn a new one so your investments are not wasted.
