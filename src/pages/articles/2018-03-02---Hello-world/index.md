Hello everyone! This is my first post on my new, simple, minimalistic blog!

Please, feel free to look around, to know me better, maybe work together or learn something new about technologies, projects, problem solving and everything else related to IT, web development, psychology, productivity which will could help you to be better developers or clients and work together more seamlessly.

I'm definately excited and eager to write a lot interesting things in the future.

Here's one of my favourite quotes to start the blog with which symbolizes what I will try to provide for you. See you in the next articles!
