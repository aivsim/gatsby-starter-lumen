Welcome to my first weekly development post about my adventure to the world of never ending profesional improvement. In this series I will try to keep a track and reflect some of my weekly learnings, work progress and along with it share my thoughts and opinions.

### Work 
* Started rewriting a Reporting project front-endside  from Angular 1.5 to React, redux, saga. Added .NET Core project and configured proxy;
* Managed to fix quite a few nasty bugs about redirects, url formatting, encoding between the several different projects;
* Set products default quantity to 1 when adding product from catalog;
* Cash register errors;
* Show services in the cash register without price;
* In the new recipe, when it is signed or saved remain in the patient recipes tab;
* In the creating services module, price field must be editable when price is not found in the catalog;
* Update converter with decimalAdjust function;
* In the creating services module, total amount is NaN. Refactoring selling get function to always return value instead of null;
* In the cash regiter module, new orders are not refreshed on the IE browser;
* Unemployment module routing;

* Error tab component reloading, total count of the errors from client-side form, server errors and errors saved in the database from the communication with signalR;

### Books
This week I started reading [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) - Read from 0 to 48 page. Completed chapters about clean code, meaningful names and functions. A small summary of these chapters:

### Programming
I am quite interested in this "Blazor" project. Managed to touch and experience all the features which blazor gives for myself. Looking forward to the new releases.

### Tinkering
My ordered touch screen from ebay has arrived this week. I finally replaced the cracked one with a new one. There was a lot of glass everywhere. The hardest part was to 
remove the glued touch screen from the plastic. It took about 2 hours without a proper heater and doing it manually by cracking the screen with a screwdriver along it sides. All in all it was messy fun.

### Read articles
I've read a lot of blog posts which I was bookmarked over the last few weeks, but still I have much more articles to read in the weeks to come.

One thing to take note is that getting good at a craft takes time but also we sometimes underestimate what we know and overestimate what others do. Sometimes try to teach a pure beginner about programming, it's at that point you might be able to reflect and see that you have actually acquired a lot of knowledge in your field.
Learning a new language can be daunting because we don't like that funny feeling of being a newbie, but it's alright, it's normal and actually, the experience you had with a former language goes with you when you learn a new one so your investments are not wasted.
