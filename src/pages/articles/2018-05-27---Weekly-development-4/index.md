description: "Implemented working ASP.NET Core 2.1 SignalR solution for testing on rewriting reporting project. Upgraded several needed projects from 2.0 to 2.1 version of .NET Core. Refactored and rewrite a lot of code for the better - easier to read and much less code base. Finally managed to finish the course about flex. It was quite different experience, one who kept me entertained enough. Started to read Clean codes books chapter about error handling. Watched a lot of TV show episodes in theme of tech, programming and near future improvements."

Implemented working ASP.NET Core 2.1 SignalR solution for testing on rewriting reporting project. Upgraded several needed projects from 2.0 to 2.1 version of .NET Core. Refactored and rewrite a lot of code for the better - easier to read and much less code base. Finally managed to finish the course about flex. It was quite different experience, one who kept me entertained enough. Started to read Clean codes books chapter about error handling. Watched a lot of TV show episodes in theme of tech, programming and near future improvements.

### Work
* Reports: Add build scripts
* Reports: Add telerikReportViewer  
* Reports: Refactor and relocate ReportViewerController to API project
* Reports: Add signalR alpha implementation

### Programming
* https://mastery.games/courses/139425/lectures/2774760 - completed flex course;

### Books
[Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) - Finished reading chapter about Data structures and objects. Started to read chapter about error handling.

### Read articles
* https://www.infoq.com/articles/aspnetcore-power-of-simplicity - Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN). OWIN allows web apps to be decoupled from web servers. It defines a standard way for middleware to be used in a pipeline to handle requests and associated responses. ASP.NET Core applications and middleware can interoperate with OWIN-based applications, servers, and middleware;
* https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/05/CSharp-7.3 - New C#  7.3 features;
* https://dev.to/rwoodnz/software-devs---ready-to-tell-your-boss-to-fuck-off-4e7e - Try to recognise the likelihood of a problem at the interview stage. In my case if someone wants me to do a 3 hour tech interview to demonstrate I know one software language off by heart, commit to 40+ hours a week, and do agile calls at 3am in the morning, we may be off to a bad start. If someone is more flexible and mostly wants a hard job done regardless of hours and specific skills, has absorbed my resume and can see other people loved me, will begin with a trial period for us to get to know each other, and is open to comments and suggestions coming back at them, then we are probably onto something good.

* https://dev.to/rhymes/is-software-developer-fatigue-a-thing-2a09 - software development is coursed with so many things to learn, there is always so much things to learn and to do; 
 * https://dev.to/sam_ferree/using-the-strategy-pattern-examples-in-c-4jn6 - learned about strategy pattern. "Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchange­able. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it." Make sure you weigh the gains from applying a design pattern against the cost of applying it. Applying the strategy pattern here added an interface, and three new classes to our project. In other words: "Make sure the juice is worth the squeeze."
