However, when your mind is only on the finished product, not only do you feel frustrated in every second that you have not met that goal, but you experience anxiety in every mistake you make while practicing."

* When your goal is to pay attention to only what you are doing right now, as long as you are doing just that, you are reaching your goal in each and every moment and step. However, when your mind is only on the finished product, not only do you feel frustrated in every second that you have not met that goal, but you experience anxiety in every "mistake" you make while practicing.
* All life is practice.
* Stay on purpose. Don't be too results-oriented. There is no goal in life.
* When you focus your mind on the present moment, on the process of what you are doing right now, you are always where you want to be and where you should be.
* All these judgements require your energy, and none of that energy is going into learning.
* There is no destination in life; life is the destination.
* The problem with these ideal images is that they may not be realistic or even attainable, and in general they have nothing to do with true happiness. In fact, these images are handed to us by marketing and the media.
* Enjoy the process not the results. Flower reference, when is it perfect in its lifetime? It is always perfect.
Develop present minded approach. Nature knows what works because it does not have an ego to deal with. It is our ego that makes us create false ideas of what perfect is and whether we have reached it. Perfection is always moving away from us because it is based on present experience and perspective. To gain practicing mind - it brings us the inner peace and happiness that we cannot attain through the acquisition of any material object or cultural status.
* The knowledge that we prejudge our activities and then place them into one of the categories is very powerful. When you are doing the activity which you don't like stop yourself and ask why. You are then in a future not present, waiting another activity.
* When you attending something unenjoyable as work and the activity will take a long time, tell yourself you will work on staying present-moment.
* This produces inner peace and you accomplish more with less effort.
* Habits are learned. Choose them wisely.
* You can't change what you are unaware of.
* "Things should be this way right now, and until then i won't be happy" - this is an indicator that you've fallen out of the process, present moment.
* To form a habit, we want something like being more aware of our thoughts to be just natural behavior, not something that requires a lot of struggle.
* Be aware of what you want to achieve, that you know the motions you must intentionally repeat to accomplish the goal, and that you execute your actions without emotions or judgements; just stay on course;
* Relax and repeat and stay in process - it will create a new habit;
* Triger - to stop the flow of your emotional response to a situation and bring you into a present moment, nonjudgmental posture so that you can be in control of your actions. The trigger jolts you into awareness and reminds you it's time to commit to the process you have already decided upon.
* You need to keep reviewing these new ideas so that you can hang on to their clarity and perspective, otherwise Life steals them away.
* You will never run out of room to grow. There is a peace of knowing the race is over. Where you are right now is a place where you should be.
* I like to learn and feel that i am growing.
* Real joy is in my ability to learn and to experience my growth, moment by moment.
* In every moment that you look at the goal and compare your position to it, you affirm to yourself that you haven't reached it. In reality you need to acknowledge the goal to yourself only occasionally, using it as a rudder to keep moving you in the right direction. Swimmer reference.
* Pick a goal and be aware that you are entering the process of achieving the goal
* Simplify, small, short and slow.
* Do not be judgmental. Meditate. Do, observe, correct.
* When you notice fretting over something, you have accomplished the do portion. Now observe the behavior that you want to change. In your observation of yourself worrying, you separate yourself from the act of worrying. Now realize that the emotions you are experiencing have no effect on the problem over which you are fretting. Release yourself from the emotions as best as you can - that is the correction portion - and try to look at the problem as an Observer. Remember, you are breaking an unwanted habit in how you deal with problems. The old habit put energy into fretting and not solving problem.,
* With deliberate and repeated effort, progress is inevitable.
* When we are in the present moment, we experience life as it happens and as it really is, rather than through filters of anticipation, as when we think about the future, or through filters of analysis, as when we linger in the past.
* Everything of a spiritual nature that you acquire in life will be with you forever. Everything else will not. Houses, jobs and cars come and go; you however, are eternal.
* Most important, if we make developing our practicing mind our first order of business, then the process of becoming will become an adventure, and we will be filled with peace instead of struggle.
* This is where the fun begins.
