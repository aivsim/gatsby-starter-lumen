* Take responsibility for your team;
* There is no bad teams only bad leaders;
* Always try to understand why and ask questions;
* Remove your ego. Mission is the most important;
* Teamwork! Communicate and work as one;
* Reduce complexity. Simple, clear and concise;
* Prioritize and execute;
* Decentralized command 4-6 people. Push info up the chain. Support your own boss;
* Planning, mission analysis, clear directives for the team, simple understood by everyone, review work;
* Leading up and down the chain of command; Planning process must be standardized, everyone can understand format and terminology;
* Decisiveness amid uncertainty;
* Discipline is the pathway to freedom. Strict order, regiment and control, power to act, speak and think;

### The Dichotomy of Leadership:
* Confident but not cocky;
* Courageous but not foolhardy;
* Competitive but gracious loser;
* Attentive to details but not obsessed by them;
* Strong but have endurance
* A leader and follower;
* Humble not passive;
* Aggressive not overbearing;
* Quiet not silent;
* Calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid emotions;
* Close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than another or more important than the goo of the team; not so close that they forget who is in charge;
* Able to execute Extreme Ownership, while exercising Decentralized Command;

### Leading up or down the chain:
* Take responsibility for leading everyone in your world, subordinates and superiors alike;
* If someone isn't doing what you want or need them to do, look in the mirror first and determine what you can do better next time;
* Don't ask your leader what you should do, tell them what you are going to do;

### Prioritize and execute:
* Evaluate the highest priority problem;
* Lay out in simple, clear and concise terms the highest priority effort of your team;
* Develop and determine a solution, seek input from key leaders and from the team where possible;
* Direct the execution of that solution, focusing all efforts and resources toward priority task;
* Move on to the next highest priority problem;
* When priorities shift within the team, pass situational awareness both up and down the chain;
* Don't let the focus on one priority cause target fixation. Maintain the ability to see other problems developing;
