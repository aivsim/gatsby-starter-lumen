### Work Books key points and main ideas:

### The Dichotomy of Leadership:
A good leader must be:
	• Confident but not cocky;
	• Courageus but not foolhardy;
	• Competitive but gracious loser;
	• Attentive to details but not obsessed by them;
	• Strong but have endurance
	• A leader and follower;
	• Humble not passive;
	• Aggressive not overbearing;
	• Quiet not silent;
	• Calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid emotions;
	• Close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than another or more important than the goo of the team; not so close that they forget who is in charge;
	• Able to execute Extreme Ownership, while exercising Decentralized Command;

_A good leader has nothing to prove, but everything to prove._

### Leading up or down the chain:
	1. Take responsibility for leading everyone in your world, subordinayes and superiors alike;
	2. If someone isn't doing what you want or need them to do, look in the mirror first and determine what you can do better next time;
	3. Don't ask your leader what you should do, tell them what you are going to do;
