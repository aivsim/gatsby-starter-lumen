description: "This week was a bit shorter work-wise because of the one holiday day on Thursday. Therefore I managed to read a whole book about system architecture. On Monday I was working from home and I was amazed how much work I managed to get done. It was easier to get into the flow without any distractions. Also, I made a bit of progress on Clean Code book - a realy interesting read, confirming my own opinions about the clean code principles. And on top of that, here and there managed to cram in a few articles."
