Finished reading my to do reading list. Completed "Clean Code" chapter about error handling.

Got a request to work on a new functionality model on a previous <a href="/experience/projects/integration-platform-for-the-business-processes-of-buyers-and-suppliers">project</a> i was working on. I will need to implement barcode functionality for products. I've already done some analytical work about what I will need to implement, reviewed and restructured module requirements. I will be working on it after work hours and on weekends, so I foresee that I will not have much time to do anything else for weeks to come.

### Work

* Reports: Add multi-tenancy support
* Chat: proxy fixes and investigation
